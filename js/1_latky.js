     "Purpose":"Faster development of muscle mass",
     "Mechanism":"A higher dose of male hormones results in faster growth of muscles, production of osseous tissue, red blood cells and neural links.",
     "Risks":"Risk of sudden death, liver / kidney dysfunction, mental changes (aggression, decrease / increase in libido), male features in women, risk of prostate enlargement and carcinoma and gynaecomastia (enlarged mammary glands) in men."

     "img_sporty":"kultur, sprint, beh, koule, vzper, plavani",
     "Purpose":"Muscle mass preservation, better defined muscles",
     "Mechanism":"It relaxes muscles in the area of the air passages; as a side effect it speeds up metabolism and therefore fat burning too. There is no loss in muscle mass; according to some studies it even speeds up muscle growth. ",
